# module-2-assignment

This is a my first version of a portfolio page. It is divided into five main sections: a header with navigation bar, an "About Me" section, a "Skills" section, a "Portfolio" section, and a "Get in Touch" or contact section.

The navigation bar is interactive and allows the user to jump right to the section that interests them.

The contact section links you directly to my LinkedIn, GitHub, e-mail, and phone depending on the link clicked. The phone link works with Skype or a mobile's default calling app.
